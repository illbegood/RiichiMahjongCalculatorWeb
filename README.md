# RiichiMahjongCalculator

Angular web-app for calculating the score of Japanese Mahjong Hands with helpful tooltips. For those wondering, I did use version control for this project. However the lack of other software engineering artifacts may actually indicate the absence of certain practices.

To run locally, run command: `ng serve` with the angular-cli installed.




> Mahjong can be an overwhelmingly complex game. For a beginner there are many things to learn. When I first started, I was struggling to learn the various rules of mahjong and 30+ unique yaku. And once I finally won a round, I had to calculate the score. This was usually the most tilting part of the game for me and my friends. We didn't know many yaku or even the calculation formula and so we used a calculator. But it still took a long time, and once we were finished, we weren't even sure if it was correct. We wouldn't know what tanyao or even pinfu was and would go and search it up which would take even more time.

> Back then, what I thought was important was playing and learning the basic game itself, not the calculations that came after a round was over. I built this calculator to help people like me and my friends who wanted to learn this wonderful game of riichi mahjong. Along with the most basic functions of any mahjong calculator, this calculator also has tooltips for all the yaku, fu, han, and the point scoring system in general. If you hover your mouse over the texts/buttons mentioned above, you will see their pronunciations and descriptions. Now, instead of having to go and search for what tanyao is or what was the scoring formula, it is all compiled into one place.

I hope that you are able to find some use for this calculator.
